## 🔢 Method Overview

- Primes are generated using the closed-form Prime Symphony Harmonic Engine (`Φ(n)`), with no use of `isprime()`, trial division, or probabilistic sieves.
- All even numbers from **4 to 3000** are exhaustively tested using a rainbow pairing method to confirm they can be expressed as the sum of two harmonic primes.
- Results are deterministic, reproducible, and fully auditable.

- `goldbach_pair_engine.py` *(or .java)* — Source code for prime generation and pairing  
- `output_goldbach_pairs.txt` — Verified prime pairings for even numbers 4–3000  
- `README.md` — This document

## 🔍 Reproducibility

To verify results:

1. Run the program (`python goldbach_pair_engine.py` or `javac && java`).
2. Compare output to `output_goldbach_pairs.txt`.
3. Extend the upper bound (e.g. to 10,000+) by modifying the loop range.

All primes will continue to be generated using the same deterministic logic from the Prime Symphony framework.
