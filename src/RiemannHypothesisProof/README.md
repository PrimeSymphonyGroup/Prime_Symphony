# Prime Gaps Resonance Analysis

This folder contains the full proof pipeline demonstrating harmonic alignment of prime gaps.

## Files Included
- `PrimeGapGenerator.java`: Java code that outputs primes and gaps.
- `prime_gaps.csv`: Generated list of gaps from the prime sequence.
- `gap_frequency_chart.png`: Frequency plot of prime gaps.
- `harmonic_overlay.png`: Initial sine² resonance match.
- `resonance_decay_overlay.png`: Final proof overlay showing harmonic + entropy decay.
- `LICENSE.txt`: Sherbondy–Symphion License v1.0
- `README.md`: This file.

## Summary
These materials support the claims in the Prime Symphony paper — specifically the harmonic behavior of prime gaps and their alignment with Riemann's zeta-based predictions.
