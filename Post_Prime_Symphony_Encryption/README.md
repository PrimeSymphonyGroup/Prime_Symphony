## 🔐 Overview

DSS-FLOATID is a post-prime, post-quantum identity proof system that generates secure identity tokens using harmonic float interference derived from prime structures. It complements the Prime Symphony framework and forms the basis of DSS certificates.

## 🧪 Implementations

- Python: [`floatid_prototype.py`](./floatid_prototype.py)
- Java: [`FloatIDGenerator.java`](./FloatIDGenerator.java)

Each implementation demonstrates:

- Prime + Level normalization
- Sin/Cos interference
- Float quantization
- SHA-512 hashing
- Salt integration for replay protection
