### üîê Introduction

This document outlines the implementation rules, ethical design framework, and allowable manufacturer modifications for integrating VaultKey and DSS Bluetooth Secure Pairing into commercial hardware. Manufacturers are encouraged to innovate on hardware while strictly adhering to DSS core cryptographic and trust protocols.

The purpose of this system is to empower users with cryptographic identity control over Bluetooth pairing, enabling a new class of privacy-respecting, tamper-resistant devices without monopolizing user data or trust chains.

### üè¢ Manufacturer Integration Model

**What Manufacturers *Can* Do:**

* Design and build Bluetooth-compatible VaultKey-ready devices (e.g., earbuds, speakers, smartwatches, phones, medical devices)
* Choose hardware specs (battery size, casing, waterproofing, EMP resistance, display types)
* Customize firmware *appearance* (LEDs, UI prompts, screen messages)
* Offer product tiers (e.g., VaultKey Basic, VaultKey Pro, VaultKey Rugged)
* Add enhancements like biometric triggers, voice pairing prompts, or physical tamper seals
* Sell hardware with DSS trust certification (once approved)

**What Manufacturers *Cannot* Do:**

* Modify DSS core logic or pairing protocol
* Override VaultKey user decisions
* Lock devices to accounts or phone numbers
* Transmit user certs or metadata externally without consent
* Add backdoors, telemetry, or silent pairing features
* Bypass VaultKey's TPC (Trusted Pairing Chain) approval steps
* Monetize the cert lifecycle (e.g., subscriptions to pair devices)

### üõ°Ô∏è DSS Bluetooth Secure Pairing Protocol Summary

Every DSS-compatible Bluetooth device must:

1. **Request Pairing via DSS Cert Chain**

   * Originating device sends initiation request with signed DSS certificate
2. **VaultKey Challenge Phase**

   * VaultKey (hardware fob or embedded module) verifies cert
   * Checks user approval or rolling-cert continuity
3. **Device-to-Device Secure Pairing**

   * Once authorized, Bluetooth device generates its own DSS cert
   * Cert is tied to MAC address and cryptographic session ID
4. **Connection Completion**

   * Devices exchange short-lived encryption handshake
   * Session key is stored with expiration on both ends

VaultKey retains pairing history and cert lineage, enabling secure revocation or audit without cloud dependence.

### üîπ VaultKey Ecosystem Roles

| Entity         | Role                                            | Access Level               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| User           | Owns DSS certs, approves or denies pairings     | Full control               |
| VaultKey       | Guardian of user identity, stores private certs | Enforces logic             |
| Manufacturer   | Builder of hardware supporting DSS              | No access to cert keys     |
| App (optional) | UI layer for user interaction                   | Interacts via VaultKey API |

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Device Tiers & Labeling

All VaultKey-compliant hardware must include one of the following trust labels:

| Label              | Trust Behavior                                              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| üü¢ DSS-Compatible  | User can pair via DSS or insecure fallback                  |
| üîµ DSS-Recommended | Defaults to DSS, fallback still available                   |
| üî¥ DSS-Required    | Will not pair without VaultKey approval                     |
| ‚ö´ DSS-Restricted   | Only works within private DSS ecosystem (e.g., medical use) |

Packaging must also include DSS Trust Manifesto and link to open protocol spec.

### üèõ Open Manufacturing License Tiers

| Tier                 | For                             | Cost       | Requirements                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| üü¢ Open Personal Use | DIYers, hackers, academia       | Free       | Attribution, no resale        |
| üîµ Community Vendor  | Small indie shops               | Minimal    | Hardware audit, ethics pledge |
| üî∂ Certified Partner | Corporations (e.g., Bose, Sony) | % royalty  | Signed DSS Hardware Agreement |
| üî¥ Denied/Closed Use | Surveillance, military use      | Prohibited | No license granted            |

### üìÑ Required Inclusions in Firmware

All firmware must:

* Embed core DSS cryptographic functions (supplied as sealed module)
* Interface via approved VaultKey API calls
* Log pairing requests locally (encrypted, user-reviewable)
* Alert on unauthorized access attempts
* Respect VaultKey role as *sole trust anchor*

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Penalty for Violation

Violation of these rules results in:

* Immediate license revocation
* Public delisting of manufacturer from DSS Trust Registry
* Legal action under Sherbondy‚ÄìSymphion License terms

---

### üîß Future-Proofing & Customization

Manufacturers are encouraged to:

* Improve durability, UI, accessibility, and form factors
* Offer third-party VaultKey accessories under same license
* Contribute code to open VaultKey firmware interface
* Join DSS development community
